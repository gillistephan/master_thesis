   abstract = {Objects to change within a manufacturing enterprise can be products, technological or logistical processes, parts of the manufacturing facilities or a company's organization. For this paper we assume, that IT systems are also objects to change -they have to be adapted to changes to products and facilities on the shop floor. Today the adaption of IT systems is managed and done manually -therefore the authors propose an automated way of changing the production's IT-systems. For this purpose two main ideas are described: reading and interpreting a self-description of production equipment and enrichment of these descriptions with data from the "digital factory" bridging the gap between planning and operating IT-systems and thus enabling higher adaptivity of manufacturing systems.},

   abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

   abstract = {Information interoperability is of paramount importance to Industry 4.0 (I4.0). To this end, the Reference Architecture Model for I4.0 (RAMI4.0) defines the Asset Administration Shell (AS) concept as a core element for interoperable descriptions of assets. Assets, such as Cyber-Physical Systems, are building blocks that need to be interchangeable between various industrial systems but are heterogeneously modeled. In order to achieve the required interoperability between these systems, semantics is key. Typically, two types of systems occur in I4.0 scenarios: legacy systems not considering explicit semantics, and a new generation of ontology-based systems. However, existing approaches for modeling the AS do not explicitly address this situation of interoperability between systems of such different types. In this article, we develop an ontological view of the AS concept to bridge the gap between these types of systems. This results in an ontology that is intended to be likewise realizable with both ontology-based and non-ontology-based systems. We present this ontology together with a suggested two-phase engineering process for its application.},

   abstract = {The increasing complexity and heterogeneity of Internet of Things-based production processes require the development of new control paradigms. Autonomous assets can be enablers for mastering the new challenges. Digital representations in particular play a decisive role here. Within the framework of Industry 4.0, the concept of the asset administration shell is being promoted in order to enable standardization of the use of digital representations. To enable autonomous decision making, the development of active asset administration shells is required. While the specification process of the asset administration shell is still ongoing and major changes are conceivable, a highly customizable implementation of the asset administration shell concept is needed. This paper depicts a flexible and lightweight framework for implementing active asset administration shells with respect to the ongoing specification process of the Industry 4.0 component.

@article{Lastra2006,
   abstract = {One of the significant challenges for current and fu- ture manufacturing systems is that of providing rapid reconfigura- bility in order to evolve and adapt to mass customization. This chal- lenge is aggravated if new types of processes and components are introduced, as existing components are expected to interact with the novel entities but have no previous knowledge on how to collab- orate. This statement not only applies to innovative processes and devices, but is also due to the impossibility to incorporate knowl- edge in a single device about all types of available system compo- nents. This paper proposes the use of Semantic Web Services in order to overcome this challenge. The use of ontologies and ex- plicit semantics enable performing logical reasoning to infer suf- ficient knowledge on the classification of processes that machines offer, and on how to execute and compose those processes to carry out manufacturing orchestration autonomously. A series of moti- vating utilization scenarios are illustrated, and a research roadmap is presented.},

   abstract = {Traditional manufacturing systems are suitable for mass pro- duction with low diversity. Since they have hard coded control logic, reconfiguration for new production tasks becomes dif- ficult after deployment. In this paper, we present a novel architecture of a decision-making engine that derives an optimal or near optimal execution strategy leveraging an I4.0 service-oriented architecture. The execution strategy for manufacturing processes consists of a routing policy and a scheduling strategy. The engine analyses the current overall condition of the plant with regard to production progress and pending tasks and evaluates the potential solutions us- ing discrete-event simulation. By applying a two-level search method, our approach is able to identify an optimized pro- duction strategy within a reasonable time. This enables the manufacturing system to react flexibly to new production orders and to integrate them into running production pro- cesses, which in particular also enables profitable realization of small lot sizes. To show the feasibility of our approach, we also show our validation activities.},

To support such variety in products, we suggest a capability- based approach for production planning and scheduling. Pro- duction plans and machines are described in terms of required capabilities and provided capabilities respectively. Additionally, the topology of the factory is described. We propose to combine these descriptions to automatically generate production schedules that consider the material flow in the factory. For each production plan, our approach generates a valid schedule for the currently available machines in the factory without manually reconfiguring the software. The evaluation of the approach on an industrial production system used for educational purposes shows the suitability of this approach},

Syntactic descriptions of input and output parameters, e.g., using interface description languages (IDL), are not sufficient when it comes to evaluating whether a manufacturing resource provides the capabilities that are required for performing a particular process step on a product. The semantics of capabilities needs to be explicitly modelled and must be provided together with manufacturing resources. In this paper, we introduce concepts developed by the German BaSys 4.0 initiative dealing with semantically describing manufacturing skills, orchestrating higher- level skills from basic skills, and using them in a cognitive manufacturing framework.},

   abstract = {At present, manufacturing processes are highly tailored to a specific product. Changes in product requirements therefore lead to big manual efforts for adapting the manufacturing process and reconfiguring production resources accordingly. Existing approaches do not cope well with this complexity. This hinders agile, customer-oriented manufacturing. A promising approach for automated assembling processes is the Machine as a Service paradigm, which aims for providing production resources on demand. This requires a consistent and pervasive formalization of product specifications, the corresponding manufacturing resources and their interdependencies. Thus, our first contribution is a generic and extensible multi-level and modular modeling framework to formalize products and available resources. Our framework is scalable for large companies and enables reuse for cross-company collaboration and supplier integration. Thereby, the static relationship between product, process and resource is avoided by describing product features and resource skills in separate models. Our framework uses the standardized SysML/UML. Our second contribution is the ability of our framework to integrate different standards. For demonstration, we apply our multi-level approach to a flexible assembly of terminal boxes for transmission gears and show the integration of standards by embedding the eCl@ss classification.},
