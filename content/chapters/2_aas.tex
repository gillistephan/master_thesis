\section{Asset Administration Shell} \label{sec:assetadministrationshell}
As outlined in chapter \ref{sec:digitaltwin}, the \ac{AAS} is the realization of the \ac{DT} in the context of \ac{I4.0} and contains all relevant data and functions necessary to represent the physical asset in the information world. Figure \ref{fig:structureaas} shows the \ac{AAS} with its structure and characteristic features.

The \ac{AAS} consists of two parts: The manifest and the component manager. The manifest contains metadata regarding the \ac{I4.0} component, such as a global unique identifier that can be used to identify the \ac{I4.0} component in the value chain. In addition, the metadata provides information whether the \ac{I4.0} component is of type or instance according to the life cycle \& value stream axis in \ac{RAMI4.0}. The component manager provides the uniform interface of the \ac{AAS}, through which the essential properties and functions of the asset can be realized. The goal of the \ac{AAS} is to accommodate as many application scenarios and use cases as possible, so that a variety of different data and functions can be provided \cite[p. 25]{Adolphs2016StructureComponent}. Complex machines, plants and components often consist of several thousand properties in different variants and offer a multitude of functionalities. To group the properties and functions according to their use case, they are represented in submodels within the \ac{AAS}. A submodel describes exactly one property or function of the \ac{I4.0} component in a semantically uniform way. A submodel can model general aspects of the asset or specialized capabilities such as drilling, milling or analytical aspects used for predictive maintenance \cite[p. 23]{Belyaev2021ModellingECLASS}. By encapsulating the properties and functions in independent submodels, the integration of the \ac{I4.0} component in \ac{SOA} is made possible. This way, other \ac{I4.0} components can use the component manager of the \ac{AAS} to query exactly the property or call the function that is needed \cite[p. 6]{Koschnick2016Beispiele4.0-Komponente-Basisteil}, without implementing the full functionality of the asset.

A central vision of \ac{I4.0} is that components can communicate autonomously with each other and make decisions based on contextual information. Although the \ac{AAS} provides a way to query data for different use cases using the component manager, the received data is not directly machine-interpretable nor direct inferences for other components are possible. An explicit knowledge representation in the form of semantic referencing is necessary. For this reason, the \ac{AAS} offers the possibility to reference individual functions and properties of submodels with concept descriptions. Concept descriptions contain the meaning of a property or function of the submodel with all its elements \cite[p. 26]{Bedenbender2019VerwaltungschalePraxis}. Through the exchange of concept descriptions, two components with no previous knowledge of each other's type and interaction models can interact with each other autonomously. To illustrate the structure of a submodel element and the necessity of concept descriptions, Table \ref{tab:rotationspeedex} shows an exemplary submodel element for a property rotation speed of a motor taken from \citet[p. 26]{Belyaev2021ModellingECLASS} \footnote{The table presents the essential properties in a simplified form for better understanding and makes no claim to completeness. A complete example of a submodel including different elements can be seen in \cite[p. 146]{Bader2020Details3.0RC01}}. The value 200 is the expression defined in the submodel. Without the reference to the concept description, it is not immediately clear that this value is the maximum rotation speed of the motor. By referencing the concept description, other components in the system are able to make decisions or perform further calculations. In this example, there could be another component in the system that continuously monitors the rotation speed. Using the \textit{MaxRotationSpeed} property, this component could regulate the rotation speed by continuously comparing the two values. While the functionality as such is not new, however the components are interchangeable and manufacturer independent as long as they are able to interpret and calculate the values based on the submodel. \citet[p. 4]{Lastra2006SemanticRoadmap} found that by introducing semantic referencing in \ac{CPS} new or unknown components can be integrated into systems by asking the question "\textit{can it perform process X?}" rather than "\textit{what vendor/model is it?}".

In addition to semantic referencing, standardization of properties is an important element of the \ac{AAS} to ensure interoperability. In order to establish a high degree of standardization, four types of characteristics for submodels are distinguished \cite[p. 88]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}: Basic, mandatory, optional and independent characteristics. The basic and mandatory characteristics aim to reflect the highest possible standardization of a single aspect or capability of an asset. By doing so, individual software solutions do not have to be developed for every single use case and solutions can be used across industries. Optional characteristics are standardized, but not essential to the operation of the asset. Independent characteristics are vendor-specific and therefore neither mandatory nor standardized. 

In order to show the practical implementation as well as the advantages of standardization and semantic reference in concrete terms, two examples of the digital nameplate and predictive maintenance are presented below:

\begin{itemize}

    \item [] \textbf{Digital Nameplate} An example of how to model a general aspect of an asset using a submodel is provided by the digital nameplate. The digital nameplate was developed by the \ac{ZVEI} to provide all legally required information and labeling for the distribution as well as the use of an asset in a digital and standardized form. The starting point of the development was the increasing amount of information and documentation that manufacturers have to provide when selling and operating an asset. In order to sell an asset, manufacturers are required to affix a nameplate to the asset that provides key product usage and classification information for different stakeholders. To cope with the growing amount of mandatory information, taking into account labeling requirements for international sales, manufacturers moved to provide extensive paper documentation when selling the asset. The implementation and maintenance of the documentation causes high costs and efforts \cite[p. 1]{ZVEI2020DasVernetzt}. In order to reduce the effort and cost of maintenance, product documentation as well as services regarding the asset along the entire life cycle can be made available digitally in a submodel of the \ac{AAS}. For this purpose, the manufacture places a QR-code on the asset, which can be scanned using a QR-code-reader to query the related information, documentation and services for the asset. To ensure interoperability, manufacturers are obliged to indicate in the submodel at least the manufacturer's name, its address, product name as well as product type, serial number, country and year of manufacture. This kind of standardization allows a wide range of use cases to be realized: Using the digital nameplate, the inventory of components of a shop floor can be recorded directly in the \ac{ERP} or the product can be automatically checked during customs inspection \cite[p. 4]{ZVEI2020DasVernetzt}
    
    \item [] \textbf{Predictive Maintenance} The use case presented in the following builds on the one described in \ref{fig:valuenetworksi40}. The author's goal is to implement a technology independent approach to predictive maintenance using the \ac{AAS} and its submodels. By describing the functionalities of a predictive maintenance system in a generic way without its concrete implementation, functionalities among different assets and components of both IT and OT can easily be assigned. Since the  \ac{AAS} is a vendor independent digital representation, the predictive maintenance system can be applied to a variety of manufacturers and assets, given that the appropriate submodels are made available in the \ac{I4.0} component. The realization of the predictive maintenance system via the \ac{AAS} was carried out by identifying the main elements of a predictive maintenance system: data acquisition, data processing and maintenance decision making \cite[p. 4]{Cavalieri2020AShell}. In a second step, nine logical blocks were derived on the basis of the main elements, which model the general properties and functionalities used in the  predictive maintenance system. These are for example the measured value, its transformation as well as the calculation of mean values. The logical blocks were then mapped in two submodels \textit{condition monitoring} and \textit{maintenance}. The submodel \textit{condition monitoring} combines data acquisition and data processing properties and functionalities. The submodel \textit{maintenance} maps the main element decision making. The prediction function itself was not represented in a submodel because the authors found it  difficult to generalize \cite[p. 10]{Cavalieri2020AShell}. Proof of practical interoperability was provided by implementing the outlined solution on 100 milling machines from different manufacturers. The authors were able to show that the process of data collection, harmonization and evaluation for predictive maintenance could be standardized to such an extent that it could be applied to different manufacturers' machines without any adoption of the submodels  \cite[p. 17]{Cavalieri2020AShell}.  
\end{itemize}

In general, it can be assumed that not every component within a system can be directly be equipped or described with an \ac{AAS}. This can have both, economic and technical reasons \footnote{A good classification about when and for which components it makes sense to provide a separate \ac{AAS} is given in this podcast by Bosch Rexroth \cite{Noll2021WasRexroth}.}. Depending on how the \ac{I4.0} component is implemented, the \ac{AAS} can take different forms. To this end, the role of the \ac{AAS} in value networks is considered, as well as the method of distribution and the composition of the \ac{AAS}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [] \textbf{Role in value networks} A distinction is made between active and passive \ac{AAS}s. Passive \ac{AAS}s only provide their information in a standardized format via file or via \ac{API} access. The \ac{AAS} therefore provides read-only access to the properties in the submodels. Active \ac{AAS}s communicate directly with each other based on the \ac{I4.0} language, described in \ref{sec:interaction-i4.0-comp} \cite[p. 19]{Bedenbender2019VerwaltungschalePraxis}. In this process, the \ac{AAS}s carry out the tasks and requests without a central control unit; rather, the \ac{AAS}s contact each other independently. 
    
    \item [] \textbf{Distribution} The distribution of the \ac{AAS} can be done in two ways. The \ac{AAS} can be stored directly on the asset or distributed in a higher level system. Assets that have \ac{I4.0} compatible communication capabilities can provide the \ac{AAS} itself for example via \ac{OPCUA}. It is also possible to make the \ac{AAS} available via a \ac{SBC} such as a Raspberry Pi, for assets that do have a controller but do not have direct \ac{I4.0} compatible communication capabilities. The communication would then be realized exclusively via the respective \ac{SBC}.  For assets that do not have \ac{I4.0} compatible communication capabilities and do not have a control unit, the provisioning and communication of the \ac{AAS} is realized via a central repository. The central repository can be the \ac{ERP}-System or a dedicated database, that stores the submodels of the \ac{AAS} \cite[p. 18]{Bedenbender2019VerwaltungschalePraxis}.
    
    \item [] \textbf{Composition} Two types of composition are distinguished. An asset can occur through one or more \ac{AAS}. This assumes that the \ac{AAS}s represent the various aspects of \ac{RAMI4.0} and relate to each other. One \ac{AAS} can also represent multiple assets. This is the case when multiple individual assets are combined into a composite \ac{I4.0} component. For example, when a manufacture sells an entire milling center, where the individual elements of the milling center provide their own \ac{AAS}, which are referenced then in the \ac{AAS} of the milling center. \cite[p. 29]{Adolphs2016StructureComponent}.
 \end{itemize}

\section{Interaction between I4.0 components} \label{sec:interaction-i4.0-comp}
The presented use cases of digital nameplate as well as predictive maintenance describe the role of passive \ac{AAS} in value networks. However, to realize the vision of \ac{I4.0}, individual \ac{AAS} must communicate autonomously with each other and therefore be active. Based on the use case of Plug and Produce, the interaction model of \ac{I4.0} components and thus active \ac{AAS} will be presented in the following. As outlined in \ref{chap:introduction} companies are moving towards \ac{SOA} to increase the flexibility of production to realize order-controlled production. This is necessary because in an \ac{I4.0} compliant system no fixed allocation of production resources to the product being produced can be made in advance. Instead, production resources must be selected during runtime and configure themselves dynamically according to the given job \cite[p. 6]{Bock2016Weiterentwicklung4.0-Komponenten}. To realize this, the production resources under consideration for executing the needed production steps must interact with each other. The goal of the interaction is to determine which of the available resources can best meet the requirements for a given job in terms of cost, time and quality,  carry out the commissioning of the selected components, as well as to carry out the production process. 

The interaction to define the production process in Plug and Produce consists of two essential steps: Capability and feasibility checking. Capability checking describes the process of determining whether a resource within a value network is suitable in general for executing a given job \cite[p. 6]{Bayha2020DescribingComponents}. For this purpose, a request from a service in the functional layer in \ac{RAMI4.0} is sent to the available \ac{AAS} in the value network. Based in the request, the individual components decide, whether they can execute the order by matching the request parameters with their properties in the submodel and respond to the service \cite[p. 20]{Bock2016Weiterentwicklung4.0-Komponenten} \footnote{\citet[p. 22]{Bock2016Weiterentwicklung4.0-Komponenten} present an example illustration of the interaction between two \ac{I4.0} components for the negotiation of a production order.}. The final decision about which component will execute the given job is made by the requesting service. While capability checking focuses on the functionality of the individual components, feasibility checking assures that the selected component in the value networking is able to perform the task according to the specified requirements by checking various conditions \cite[p. 6]{Bayha2020DescribingComponents} \cite[p. 15]{Bock2016Weiterentwicklung4.0-Komponenten}. The checking of conditions in a Plug and Produce system is done by the interaction of two \ac{I4.0} components. In case of a robot that moves objects from A to B, this could be the condition that the object to be moved is actually located at location A by another component or service.

An important requirement for \ac{SOA} is, that the services within the \ac{SOA} are loosely coupled and not controlled by a central instance. It follows, that each service or \ac{I4.0} component within an \ac{I4.0} system manages its state by itself. This is important in that way, as this allows any other service or component within the \ac{I4.0} system to query the state and make its own decision based on it. Basically there are different states an \ac{I4.0} component can have and depends on the individual use case \cite[p. 30]{Epple2018BaSysAufbaus}. To illustrate this, the commissioning process in the Plug and Produce use case will be explained based on the work of \citeauthor{Schweizer2021ProcessSystems}.   

In order to be able to communicate both vertically and horizontally as part of an I4.0 system, a uniform set of rules must therefore be defined for communication so that messages can be exchanged between machines in a readable and interoperable manner. With the help of the \ac{I4.0} language, a set of grammar and rules are defined to make this possible. The \ac{I4.0} language defines three essential components for realization. These are vocabulary, message structure, and interaction protocol \cite[p. 12, figure 8]{Bock2016Weiterentwicklung4.0-Komponenten} and are described in the following.

\begin{itemize}
    \item [] \textbf{Vocabulary} A distinction is made between basic vocabulary and domain-specific vocabulary \cite[p. 12]{Bock2016Weiterentwicklung4.0-Komponenten}. The main elements of the vocabulary are the properties of the \ac{AAS}, which are stored in the submodels.
    \item [] \textbf{Message Structure} Message basically consist of an identification and data area. The identification area is used for the identification of the sender and receiver as well as for the conversation and message itself. The data area consists of the action and the associated data elements \cite[p. 17]{Bock2016Weiterentwicklung4.0-Komponenten}.
    \item [] \textbf{Interaction Protocol} An interaction protocol arise from a sequence of messages exchanged between \ac{I4.0} components to accomplish a task and the submodels involved to perform the task \cite[p. 13]{Bock2016Weiterentwicklung4.0-Komponenten}.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:interaction-concept-i40} illustrates the relationship between the individual components of the \ac{I4.0} language. The vocabulary is defined in the submodels and the interaction between the individual \ac{AAS}s takes place by means of messages. The autonomous interaction of the components takes place via the interaction protocols, which specify the sequence of the task. The component manager, which was introduced in \ref{sec:assetadministrationshell} receives the message, executes the required action within the submodel and communicates the decision of the action via the interaction protocol.

\section{Classification in RAMI 4.0}

Using the examples of the digital nameplate, predictive maintenance as well as plug and produce it became clear the the type of asset belonging to an \ac{I4.0} component determine its location in \ac{RAMI4.0}. In case of the \ac{AAS} for the digital nameplate, it can be concluded, that this extends until the information layer in \ac{RAMI4.0}. 

\textbf{\ac{AAS} until Information Layer}
The data of the respective \ac{I4.0} component is manifested in the \ac{AAS} in the form of submodels using properties or list of properties. Likewise, the vocabulary of the \ac{I4.0} language is anchored in the submodels, which can be used to provide read access to the data of the \ac{AAS}. \ac{I4.0} components without a functional and business layer only contain the option for data retrieval and persistence and can therefore not represent active participants for business processes, since they can neither execute activities nor synchronize with other process participants by means of message exchange.
