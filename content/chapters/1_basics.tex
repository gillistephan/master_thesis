\chapter{Basics}
This chapter describes the concepts necessary for a basic understanding of the research question. To this end, the first step is to introduce the concept of value networks. Specifically, the implementation of these in the context of \ac{I4.0} is discussed using practical examples. This is intended to demonstrate the need for a reference model for \ac{I4.0}, which will be explained in more detail in the next step. Since the \ac{I4.0} component plays a central role within \ac{RAMI4.0}, it will be discussed afterwards. The \ac{I4.0} component with its \ac{AAS} corresponds to the digital twin in the industrial context. For this reason, a general introduction to digital twins is given first and then the reference to the \ac{I4.0} component and \ac{AAS} is established. In a final step, \ac{BPM} is presented with the necessary elements for modeling.

\section{Value Networks in Industrie 4.0} \label{sec:valuenetworks}
\citet[p. 6]{Sturgeon2001HowNetworks} defines value chains as the connection of value-adding activities of a company in order to create a product or a service. The activities can have complex relationships to each other and can take place at different locations. Within a company, all departments that are involved in the production or sale of a product are part of the value chain \cite[p. 10]{Sturgeon2001HowNetworks}. \citeauthor{Sturgeon2001HowNetworks} refers to this type of networking as vertical networking. Whereas the value chain focuses on the individual product, the term value network covers all value chains in which a company operates. A value network can include various cooperating as well as legally independent companies. To this end, each company within the network contributes its core competencies in order to achieve collaborative competitive advantages and create value through their mutual interaction \cite[p. 3]{Bach2010GeschaftsmodelleGrundlagen}. Consequently, value networks have in addition to the vertical networking also a horizontal networking, namely the connection across company boundaries. Value networks have therefore the potential to create new product-service bundles both, within and across companies traditional scope. Thus, companies can use value networks on the one hand to grow their existing core business, but also expand their network by tapping into new market segments \cite[p. 22]{Acatech2013Recommendations4.0}.

In the context of \ac{I4.0} especially the horizontal integration through value networks has increased. The horizontal integration is driven by the vision of autonomously acting resources within a network that can configure themselves, automatically respond to different situations, and make decisions accordingly. Horizontal networking in \ac{I4.0} is therefore almost exclusively technology-based \cite[p. 20, 21]{Acatech2013Recommendations4.0}. The control of the resources is made possible by the fact, that all relevant information is available in real-time through the networking of all instances of value creation. This enables constant evaluation and optimization of processes on the basis of the collected data \cite[p. 24]{Acatech2013Recommendations4.0}. 

The horizontal connection of partners within a value network in \ac{I4.0} is typically realized via \ac{IIOT} platforms or digital ecosystems. An \ac{IIOT} platform is characterized by the interaction of entities, information systems, business partners and people to drive production and operations in which each of the partners makes its specific added value available to other partners in the network \cite[p. 5]{Falk2020ValueChina}. In the area of \ac{IIOT} platforms, two main types are emerging. Platforms, with a generic approach, that aim to collect data in general about the use and operation of spatially distributed assets in order to gain insights \cite[p. 11]{Falk2021DigitaleEntwicklung}. On the other hand, the emergence of \ac{IIOT} platforms and ecosystems around specialized offerings of companies can be seen \cite[p. 13]{Falk2021DigitaleEntwicklung}. While the former platforms predominantly take an open platform approach, the latter are mostly closed platforms. The degree of openness of a platform refers to the possibility of integrating further partners and making the platforms content accessible to them. 

A concrete use case within an \ac{IIOT} platform represents predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance by definition refers to a maintenance process based on the evaluation of process and machine data collected by sensors \cite[p. 1670]{Selcuk2016PredictiveTrends:}. The collected data is either sent in its raw or aggregated form to the cloud, where it is stored and made available for different partners in the network. The real-time processing of the underlying data makes forecasts possible that form then the basis for needs-based maintenance. Thus, it can improve the economic efficiency of a real world asset, predict the optimal time for maintenance and improve the performance by minimizing unplanned downtime. While costs are not the only benefit of implementing predictive maintenance several other motives underlie the considerations to replace preventive maintenance by predictive maintenance. For example during agreed maintenance intervals for hardware assets, most often hardware parts are replaced, although they were neither defective nor threatened to fail \cite[p. 1672]{Selcuk2016PredictiveTrends:}. An implementation of predictive maintenance in value networks is provided by \citet[p. 11]{Cavalieri2020AShell}. While the collection of the machine data is carried out by the operator itself, a service provider takes over the implementation of the prediction and decision model in the cloud. Seamless integration is enabled by interoperable concepts, which is explained in greater detail in \ref{sec:assetadministrationshell}, for data collection, processing as well as decision making. This allows vendor-independent functionalities for predictive maintenance to be developed by one vendor, which can be use by multiple partners in the network, which increases flexibility and efficiency \cite[p. 9]{Cavalieri2020AShell}.

As outlined in the case of predictive maintenance, value networks can be the basis for manufacturing companies to generate new revenue streams and gain a competitive advantage, by connecting, merging and evaluating data on the use and operation of the entire product life cycle. While this example is of simple nature, value networks are often much more complex.

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:valuenetworksi40}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:valuenetworksi40} provides an overview of a value network in \ac{I4.0} with their roles and actors. Typically, four roles can be seen in \ac{I4.0} value networks. Usually, they are identical with the players seen along the traditional value chain. These are the suppliers, OEMs, their customers as well as consumers. In addition to the traditional suppliers, new service providers from the digital ecosystem play an important role. Each partner contributes a small or larger part to the network by bringing their unique capabilities for a special area. For example, the domain expert provides the necessary expertise to interpret the specific data collected by sensors and machines, while the data broker ensures, that the data is accessible, accurate and consistent. Based on the provided information of the domain expert, the analytic provider implements algorithms using machine learning or artificial intelligence to provide insights on a massive scale \cite{Russo2018HowCompetition}. Practical examples of value networks in \ac{I4.0} are the Airbus Skywise Platform or the Volkswagen Industrial Cloud. Skywise was launched 2017 as an internal project at Airbus with the aim of analyzing millions of data points collected during the operation of an aircraft, to get a close-up view of its condition in order to avoid defects and downtime \cite{Hanke2019AirbusWerden}. Airbus has since expanded it's ambition: Skywise aims to be the leading platform for the aircraft industry to revolutionize the way aircraft are designed, built and operated. To this end, Airbus has opened their platform to suppliers and service providers. 

This type of development is typical: First, the collected data is used to improve the companies own products, services and the internal processes (vertical integration). In a second step an open approach is taken to provide new, data-driven products and service offerings in collaboration with network partners (horizontal integration). This can be seen in most manufacturing companies. They are succeeding in the first steps, namely the formation of digital units and, in some cases, the collection and evaluation of data for the realization of cost savings and quality improvements. While these efforts by companies are mainly focused on very simple and specific use cases, a more generic solution is needed to generate new revenue models. But this is where most companies struggle, because they lack the knowledge or capital needed to build the capabilities \cite[p. 19]{Arnold2018DigitaleMittelstand}.

Therefore, in order to reach the point of developing new business models, many companies  enter cooperative ventures in order to take advantage of each others capabilities \cite{Russo2018HowCompetition}. For example, due to the lack of expertise in centralizing and analyzing large amounts of data using artificial intelligence and machine learning, Airbus entered into a cooperation with the american company Palantir \cite{Hanke2019AirbusWerden}. Another example is Volkswagen's announced cooperation with Amazon Webservices regarding the Industrial Cloud \cite{VolkswagenAG2019WirLive}. While Volkswagen contributes its expertise from the areas of vehicle construction and production, Amazon Webservices provides its knowledge from the areas of cloud, logistics and platform operation. With the announcement of the development of the Industrial Cloud, Volkswagen is pursuing the goal of bringing together all data from machines and systems from all factories across the entire group. Volkswagen has designed the Industrial cloud as an open industry platform so that almost the entire global supply chain, including all suppliers and partner companies can be integrated. Likewise, Volkswagen has announced that it is considering opening the platform to other vehicle manufacturers.

The open approach of the two companies Airbus and Volkswagen opens up new use cases for cooperation and value creation: By participating on the industrial cloud of Volkswagen, all suppliers and component manufacturers obtain more and better usage information about their products and can thus bring their product performance to the next level. This holds true especially in many cases since suppliers and component manufacturers do not have the necessary financial means to build it up themselves \cite{Russo2018HowCompetition}. The same applies to Airbus. However, this approach does not only have advantages for increasing the performance of the suppliers own products, it also enables easier access for them to services and products from other suppliers of the Volkswagen and Airbus network. 

As outlined using the example of Airbus and Volkswagen: through \ac{I4.0}, value creation networks with different companies emerge, which are characterized by complex mutual relationships. To make the complexities understandable and manageable for all partners in the value network, a common technical standard is needed (as demonstrated by the simple example of predictive maintenance). Processes and interfaces are required that define collaboration and the information to be exchanged. This can be achieved by a reference model. A reference model describes the technical description and implementation of these agreements. It thus provides a general pattern for the products and services of all cooperating companies and forms the framework for both the structuring and the development, integration and operation of the relevant technical systems. A value network consists of a wide variety of companies with different business models. The reference model has the task of bringing together the different perspectives into a common and unified view. For this purpose, it is necessary to agree on basic structuring principles as well as interfaces and data.

\section{Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0} \label{sec:rami40}
\ac{RAMI4.0} is a reference model, which enables the interdisciplinary technical data description of an asset over the entire life cycle from design to disposal as well as the consistent representation of the complex relationships of partners within a value network \cite[p. 4]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. \citet[p. 23]{Arnold2018DigitaleMittelstand} emphasize several advantages of \ac{RAMI4.0} when applied by all partners in the network. Applying \ac{RAMI4.0}, collaborations between network partners can be realized more easily and quickly, which saves transaction costs and increases efficiency. This is in particularly true because the interfaces and processes required for collaboration are standardized. A good example of how transaction costs can be reduced by applying \ac{RAMI4.0} is given by \citet[p. 11]{Bayha2020DescribingComponents}. If the interaction between two \ac{I4.0} compliant components is to be established, the transaction costs of the implementation depend on the degree of formalization of these components. The most informal way of describing interfaces and processes is when the two developers of the components use natural language to exchange the meaning of the messages and agree on a common exchange format. The authors note that this causes a high coordination effort on both sides and ultimately results in higher transaction costs for the implementation. This is confirmed empirically by \citet[p. 14]{Arnold2018DigitaleMittelstand}, which show that horizontal networking in companies is slowed down primarily by the high transaction costs caused by non-uniform standards. To reduce the coordination effort, standardized information models like \ac{OPCUA}\footnote{\ac{OPCUA} is a machine-to-machine protocol for industrial automation, which is not further discussed. More information can be found on https://opcfoundation.org/about/opc-technologies/opc-ua/} or eclass\footnote{eclass is a standard for master data management and semantics for digitization which is not further discussed. More information can be found on https://www.eclass.eu/} can be used to define a uniform vocabulary and structure. A good graphical representation of the effect can be found on page 12 in \citet{Bayha2020DescribingComponents}. In addition to reducing transaction costs, \ac{RAMI4.0} can help companies develop new business ideas and models as it provides a comprehensive overview of processes, customer requirements and competitors. Furthermore \ac{RAMI4.0} can be used to develop new software solutions in conformity with the \ac{I4.0} concept and adapt existing solutions accordingly. The latter two advantages are not discussed further, but can be read in greater detail in \citet[p. 24 ff]{Arnold2018DigitaleMittelstand}.

The main object of consideration in \ac{RAMI4.0} is an asset. An asset is described as an object that has a certain business value for a company. The term therefore not only applies to physical assets but also includes ideas and software in its definition \cite[p. 31]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. \ac{RAMI4.0} is a complex model due to the variety of processes, products and services that can be mapped in it. To simplify the complex aspects and interrelationships of an asset in the context of \ac{I4.0}, \ac{RAMI4.0} consists of three dimensions: Layers, Life Cycle \& Value Stream and Hierarchy Levels. The individual dimensions are divided into sub components to ensure that a common understanding for discussion emerges. The division into subcomponents makes it possible to present the relevant aspects of an asset at each point in the life cycle. Figure \ref{fig:rami40} shows the three axis of the model which are described in detail below.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{content/pictures/rami_4.0_zvei.jpg}
\caption{Referenzarchitekturmodell Industry 4.0}
\source{\cite{ZVEI2015TheZvei.org}}
\label{fig:rami40}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Life Cycle \& Value Stream} As a result of increasing demand of customized products and lack of capabilities, companies are concentrating more on their core competencies and increasingly outsource value-added activities \cite[p. 11]{Arnold2018DigitaleMittelstand}. This leads to a stronger linkage and dependency of the partners in the value chain as described in \ref{sec:valuenetworks}. On the Life Cycle \& Value Stream axis, these relationships of the partners in the value chain as well as the life cycle of an asset can be mapped. Since assets are no longer engineered and manufactured by only one vendor, mapping the asset over the lifecycle gives a good overview of the individual responsibilities of the partners in the network.  The life cycle of an asset is hereby divided into type and instance \cite[p. 43]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. In the first phase of the asset, the so called \textit{asset type} is created. The asset type contains all relevant data for the planing, construction and manufacturing of the asset. For this reason, the asset type acts as a blueprint from which one or more concrete \textit{asset instances} can be created in a second phase. The second phase describes the production and operation of the previously developed asset type. To ensure consistent mapping of the asset across the lifecycle, information created during production, such as material used or date of production, is added to the newly created instance. After the asset is produced, it is handed over to the customer or operator who then uses the asset, resulting in usage data \cite[p. 43]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. The recording of usage data by the customer enables the manufacturer of the asset to use it to gain insights for improving the product, by incorporating it back into the asset type.
    
\textbf{Layers} The vertical axis of the architecture model describes the structural properties of an asset. Since the theoretical foundation of the layers is very abstract, an example is added to each layer, where needed, to clarify the intention. The example is based on the use case of order controlled production, in which the customer can order an individually configured product \footnote{The use case described is based on the example of \citet[p. 39 - 41]{Anderl2016Softwarearchitekturen4.0}. The focus of the authors' mapping is on software architecture and was not felt to be relevant as a whole for this thesis. Relevant parts are therefore slightly modified and irrelevant parts omitted.}. 
    
The lowest layer in \ac{RAMI4.0} is the \textit{Asset-Layer}. It represents the real asset in the physical world \cite[p. 46]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. In the use case of order controlled production, this includes the product to be customized, the production plant including all machines as well as means of transport. 
    
The \textit{Integration-Layer} connects the physical world with the virtual world by transferring generated events and data of the physical world into the virtual world \cite[p. 46]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. The data generated by the production resources can be of different nature and format and depends on the realized use case. For the use case of order controlled production, this could be the transmission of an event that a required production resource configured itself according to the given product specification and is ready for use.  
    
The \textit{Communication-Layer} describes the access to the asset's information. This includes the protocol to use, the data format and the transmission of the data. Currently, there is a lot of heterogeneity on the store floor in protocols and technologies to describe information and data for an asset. To ensure interoperability, the protocol and data format must be according to \ac{I4.0} standards such as \ac{OPCUA} or \ac{MQTT}. This allows assets from different layers and networks to connect to each other \cite[p. 47]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. Since this layer is only responsible for the technical transmission of \ac{I4.0} compliant messages, an example is omitted. For a list of suitable protocols and standards for communication according to the OSI-model, please refer to \citet[p. 49]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}.  
    
The provision of the structured data, the processing of the events as well as the analysis of these takes place in the \textit{Information-Layer} \cite[p. 51]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. The information layer thus provides an important basis for further applications such as predictive maintenance, which are described in the functional layer. Events and data occurring during the production process of the individual product,  are stored and evaluated in the communication layer. Furthermore they are made available for processing or display in the functional layer. Applied to the example of order controlled production, a possible delay of delivery would be calculated here. Based on the current production progress, the expected delivery time could be calculated and compared with the promised delivery time.
    
Services, capabilities and functions provided by the asset are mapped in the \textit{Functional-Layer} \cite[p. 51]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. Within the function layer, a distinction is made between basic, process and manufacturer-specific functions. Basic functions are manufacturer-independent functions that base their functionality on \ac{I4.0} compliant data from the information layer. One example for this could be predictive maintenance as shown in \ref{sec:valuenetworks}. Process functions on the other hand are production specific functions such as forming, cutting or drilling. Manufacturer-specific functions are those that are not \ac{I4.0} compliant and are proprietary such as the application of a patented process. In the case of order controlled production, the business model would be mapped to the production process here. This would be done by defining the parts of the product, the customer is able to individualize and which not. The defined elements would then be integrated into the process model and functions, via standardized interfaces (e.g. Bill of Material in the \ac{DT}), as well as the ordering interface defined by the business layer.  
    
The \textit{Business-Layer} describes the business model and is responsible for orchestrating the services defined in the functional layer. It thus describes the business models and the resulting overall processes \cite[p. 53]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. In the present use case, the focus would be on the manufacturing and sale of individual products created by the customer, as well as the flexible production system. Furthermore the tools (e.g. apps or webshop) used by the customer to individualize his products would be located here.
    
\textbf{Hierarchy Levels} This axis refers to the functional classification within an \ac{I4.0} factory and ranges from product to technical plant to the networked world. This axis contains the previous elements of the automation pyramid and extends them by three levels: Product, field devices and the connected world \cite[p. 44]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. By connected world, connections to other factories, locations or partners outside of the factory are meant. The product layer was included because products can influence their production autonomously while being manufactured, thus becoming smart products in \ac{I4.0} \cite[p. 21]{Acatech2013Recommendations4.0}. Field devices are understood to be intelligent sensors and actuators that provide the link between the physical and digital world.

The description of the individual layers of \ac{RAMI4.0} show, that the modeling of business processes not only covers the top business layer, but also includes the information and function layer. While the information layer describes the data and rules required for the process, the function layer provides the functionalities for executing the defined business processes. The business layer allows the assignment and linking of processes with the required services in the function layer. In order to ensure vertical and horizontal integration of business and production processes, the information on functions, components, processes as well as their data, which is distributed across the different layers in \ac{RAMI4.0}, must be merged and made available in a uniform interface. This can be accomplished by the introduction of a \ac{DT}.

\section{Digital Twin}\label{sec:digitaltwin}

The concept of the \ac{DT} and an initial definition was first introduced by the University of Michigan in 2002. According to the definition, a \ac{DT} is a virtual representation of a physical asset that contains all relevant information of the asset \cite[p. 92]{Grieves2017DigitalSystems}. The definition states that the relevant information must cover the complete life cycle of the asset with its four phases: creation, production, operation and disposal. The \ac{DT} first found a concrete application in connection with NASA's Apollo program. The \ac{DT} was intended to help the operators on the ground and the astronauts to simulate alternatives in difficult situations by mirroring all available data of the rocket via sensors to the ground \cite[p. 94]{Grieves2017DigitalSystems}. This enabled the operators to test various decision alternatives in advance and provide the astronauts with appropriate decisions on how to optimize different aspects of the rocket. 

In general, the \ac{DT} is intended to serve as an objective basis for evaluating and simulating relationships that previously existed only implicitly and inaccurately in engineer's heads. It is therefore the basis for decisions and the optimization of systems. Its goal is to enable forecasts for the future, so that processes and resources can be planed better \cite[p .96, p.97]{Grieves2017DigitalSystems}. Within the life cycle of an asset, the \ac{DT} is the central element, which documents the changes over each cycle stage and thus enables optimized outcomes. The value proposition of a \ac{DT} is therefore to make assets more sustainable and better performing by ensuring the highest possible functionality in operation with the lowest possible use of resources \cite[p. 102]{Grieves2017DigitalSystems}
\footnote{In connection with the \ac{DT}, the digital shadow is also often mentioned. However, this is not discussed in further detail. The connection between \ac{DT} and digital shadow is described very well by \citet[p. 5]{Malakuti2021AnTwins}.}. In summary, the \ac{DT} in its original definition is primarily used as a simulation model to test and verify assumptions.

In the context of \ac{I4.0} and \ac{CPS}, there is currently no uniform definition of the \ac{DT} in scientific literature. Rather, there are different views and considerations of the digital twin regarding its tasks and applications resulting in different definitions \cite[p. 4]{Deuter2019TheTheory}. A comprehensive list of definitions of the \ac{DT} in the context of \ac{CPS} is presented by \citet[p. 941]{Negri2017ASystems}. To illustrate the different ways of thinking and approaches, two of them will be presented in the following. \citet[p. 567]{Rosen2015AboutManufacturing} take on the initial idea by using a \ac{DT} to describe an asset with all its relevant data over the lifecycle. However, in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the asset, the authors argue that data from individual production resources in the \ac{CPS} should be integrated into the \ac{DT} \cite[p. 569]{Rosen2015AboutManufacturing}. To this end, not only optimizations on the asset can be performed, but also dynamic reactions and optimizations due to changing environmental conditions can be performed on the production resource. While \citeauthor{Rosen2015AboutManufacturing} see the \ac{DT} in the life cycle of the product and the production resources in a \ac{CPS}, \citet[p. 3]{Schluse2016FromSystems} completely break away from the distinction between product and production resource and propose to map the entire \ac{CPS} and system landscape using \ac{DT}s. By mapping entire systems and system landscapes, side effects from changes of single system component can be better managed and different disciplines can be included in parallel in the development and operation \cite[p. 2]{Schluse2016FromSystems} of such systems. While the definitions chosen only refer to the meaning of a \ac{DT}, they do not provide any information about the tasks and main use cases of a \ac{DT}. 

In order to approach a uniform definition for a \ac{DT} for this thesis, the main use cases of a \ac{DT} in \ac{CPS} will be presented in the following. A good overview is provided by \citet{Son2021PastManufacturing}. Based on an extensive literature review, \citet{Son2021PastManufacturing} identified five areas in which \ac{DT} are applied in \ac{CPS}. The areas are prototyping, pilot testing, monitoring, improvement and control. These are presented below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [] \textbf{Prototyping} The application of a \ac{DT} in prototyping aims at virtually simulating certain situations in order to check predefined assumptions for an asset \cite[p. 7]{Son2021PastManufacturing}. The virtual object on which the simulation is performed contains all the properties and information that can be found in a real asset. The advantage of using a \ac{DT} in prototyping is that trial and error methods can be applied, which can save cost and time compared to the application on a real object \cite[p. 2]{Son2021PastManufacturing}. As an example, the authors cite a study that examined charging functions of an electric vehicle based on a \ac{DT}. For this purpose, a virtual environment including the vehicle was created and it was checked whether the vehicle can be charged automatically when parked.
    
    \item[] \textbf{Pilot Testing} A concrete use case of \ac{I4.0} is Plug and Produce as described in \cite{Schleipen2015Requirements4.0}. With the help of a \ac{DT}, the commissioning process of dynamic production resources can be piloted \cite[p. 9]{Son2021PastManufacturing}. This allows different setups of production lines to be compared with each other in terms of costs and performance. In the provided example by \citeauthor{Son2021PastManufacturing}, researchers were able to show that by using a \ac{DT}, a production line could be configured within a few hours, instead of 5 days. This made it possible to find the best arrangement of production resources in a production line through an iterative approach. 
    
    \item[] \textbf{Monitoring} The \ac{DT} can be used to monitor machines or other production resources in real time. For this purpose, the relevant data such as machine status or production time are stored in the \ac{DT} and visualized to an operator via a graphical interface \cite[p. 11]{Son2021PastManufacturing}. The \ac{DT} thus acts as the bridging element between the machine and the user. While the monitoring is not exclusively limited to machines or production resources, but can also be applied to logistics or other parts of the shop floor. 
    
    \textbf{Improvement} One of the core functions of the \ac{DT} is the improvement of processes and maintenance related decision making based on continuous updates of the machine data, which is stored in the \ac{DT} \cite[p. 14]{Son2021PastManufacturing}. For example, the utilization of production resources can be improved by monitoring production progress in real time. New production orders can distributed accordingly to resources that are free.
    
    \textbf{Control} Besides monitoring and improvement, the \ac{DT} can also be used to control the behaviour of a  physical asset or production resource \cite[p. 15]{Son2021PastManufacturing}. For this purpose, the functions and capabilities of an asset are made available via the \ac{DT} so that external systems can call and execute them via commands. This is shown by \citet[p. 569]{Rosen2015AboutManufacturing} using the example of an autonomous production system in which production resources are controlled exclusively by a \ac{DT}. In order to do so, sensors were attached to the required production resources, which transmitted the current state of the resource to the \ac{DT}. Using actuators, the appropriate actions were then performed based on the current state in the \ac{DT}.
    
\end{itemize}

As mentioned in chapter \ref{chap:introduction}, the implementation of the \ac{DT} in the context of \ac{I4.0} is realized by the \ac{AAS}. \ac{RAMI4.0} defines the \ac{DT} as a virtual representation of a real device, machine, service or intangible process that describes its properties and behaviour using models, data and information within its lifecylce \cite[p. 1]{Stark2020WiGep-PositonTwin}. Together with the physical asset, the \ac{AAS} forms the basis for the \ac{I4.0} component which is shown in figure \ref{fig:i40component}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig:i40component}
\end{figure}

The idea of the \ac{I4.0} component is to connect every physical object with the information world according to the layers in \ac{RAMI4.0}. For this purpose, each physical asset is surrounded by the \ac{AAS}. In the \ac{AAS}, all characteristic features of the asset of the physical world are represented in terms of standardized data. The characterization of an asset by means of properties in \ac{I4.0} is called the property principle \cite[p. 17]{Heidel2017ReferenzarchitekturmodellIndustrie4.0Komponente}. An important feature of the \ac{I4.0} component is, that it can represent not only one asset, rather it can also represent entire asset groups. This feature is especially important for the cooperation of assets, which is described in detail in \ref{sec:interaction-i4.0-comp}. Asset groups are understood to be networks of assets, such as production cells or entire factories, in which the individual assets of the asset group are made available by different participants within a value network \cite[p. 11]{Bedenbender2017BeziehungenProduktion}. The combination of several \ac{I4.0} components is called a composite component. The composite component is mapped in the information world via property relationships in the \ac{AAS}. A composite component is capable of representing both horizontal and vertical connections between assets \cite[p. 13]{Bedenbender2017BeziehungenProduktion} \footnote{The concrete implementation in the \ac{AAS} is done via the standardized property \textit{RelationshipElement} or \textit{BillOfMaterial} with which assets of different hierarchy levels can be mapped \cite[p. 32]{Bader2020Details3.0RC01}}.  Based on the definition of \ac{I4.0} component and \ac{AAS}, it can be seen that the industrial \ac{DT} can meet both definitions of \citet{Rosen2015AboutManufacturing} as well as \citet{Schluse2016FromSystems}, which is achieved through composition of \ac{I4.0} components. Similarly, the \ac{AAS} can be used to implement the use cases identified by \citet{Son2021PastManufacturing}. In general, it can be said that the notion of a \ac{DT} is a concept of mapping physical assets in the information world. The \ac{AAS} goes one step further and transfers the concept of the \ac{DT} into a concrete data structure, which is shown in greater detail in \ref{fig:structureaas}.

The conversion of physical assets into \ac{I4.0} components has several technical and economic advantages. From a technical perspective, assets that do not currently have \ac{I4.0} compliant communication capabilities as defined by \ac{RAMI4.0} can be made \ac{I4.0} compliant by implementing the \ac{AAS}. This allows these components thus to operate in an \ac{I4.0} system \cite[p. 1005]{Birtel2019FutureFit:Approach}. From an economic perspective, transaction costs for data exchange between partners in value networks can be reduced, by providing a uniform concept for structuring information. This facilitates in particular the system integration and engineering effort in heterogeneous system landscapes \cite[p. 324]{Lachenmaier2019entwicklung}. Furthermore,  \citet[p. 325]{Lachenmaier2019entwicklung} highlight that by providing \ac{I4.0} components, additional value and revenue can be created over the life cycle of the asset. To do so, the \ac{I4.0} component can be equipped with value-added services via their \ac{AAS} that are located in one of the five layers of \ac{RAMI4.0} of the information world. In addition, processes in after sales can be made more efficient, as all information of the structure and changes applied to the physical asset are documented via the \ac{AAS}. This can be used, for example, to avoid incorrect deliveries of spare parts \citet[p. 329]{Lachenmaier2019entwicklung}.

For an \ac{I4.0} component to be standard-compliant, it must meet several requirements \cite[p. 1]{Koschnick2015Die4.0-Komponente}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Identification} The \ac{I4.0} component and the containing \ac{AAS} must be uniquely identifiable worldwide.
    \item \textbf{Communication} The \ac{I4.0} component must be able to communicate using \ac{I4.0} compliant capabilities in order to realize a \ac{SOA}.
    \item \textbf{Semantics} The description of the \ac{I4.0} component must use \ac{I4.0} compliant semantics to represent data and functionalities which conforms to \ac{RAMI4.0}.
    \item \textbf{Life cycle condition} For the \ac{I4.0} component, at least \textit{asset type} or \textit{asset instance} must be detectable at any time.
\end{itemize}
